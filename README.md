# TreeScriptExample


This repository demonstrates a hierarchical tree structure for scripting in DreamBot, an Old School RuneScape botting framework. The project showcases a Tree Branch Leaf framework that organizes bot tasks into a tree structure for better modularity and scalability.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into packages that represent different levels of the tree hierarchy: high-level branches, low-level branches, and leaves.
